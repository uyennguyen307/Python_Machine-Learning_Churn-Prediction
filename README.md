# Introduction
## 1. Business Question
One e-commerce company has a project on predicting churned users to offer potential promotions. The attached file is the dataset that is offered by the company (churn_predict.csv). Using these datasets to answer the below questions:
1. What are the patterns/behavior of churned users? What are your suggestions to the company to reduce churned users?
2. Build the Machine Learning model for predicting churned users.

## 2. About Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or cancel a subscription to a service. 
Churn prediction modeling techniques attempt to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes that signal the risk and timing of customers leaving

## Business Question Solving
### 1. What are the patterns/behavior of churned users? What are your suggestions to the company to reduce churned users?
## 5. Data Processing
Check imbalanced data

% data labeled 1 on total data is 16.9%, it's quite imbalanced => process Machine Learning model as normal, after processing, if model ko nh∆∞ expect, enhance data labeled 1 on total data rate or input more data

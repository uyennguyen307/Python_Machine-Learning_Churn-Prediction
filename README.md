# Introduction
## 1. Business Question
One e-commerce company has a project on predicting churned users to offer potential promotions. The attached file is the dataset that is offered by the company (churn_predict.csv). Using these datasets to answer the below questions:
1. What are the patterns/behavior of churned users? What are your suggestions to the company to reduce churned users?
2. Build the Machine Learning model for predicting churned users.

## 2. About Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or cancel a subscription to a service. Churn prediction modeling techniques attempt to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes that signal the risk and timing of customers leaving

## 3. About Machine Learning - Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.

Replace the missing value with 0 or the median 

#### Check imbalanced data

% data labeled 1 on total data is 16.9%, it's quite imbalanced => process Machine Learning model as normal, after processing, if model ko nhÆ° expect, enhance data labeled 1 on total data rate or input more data

## Business Question Solving

Apply the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) method to detect the patterns/behavior of churned users and pick impactful fields for the Machine Learning Model

### 1. What are the patterns/behaviors of churned users? What are your suggestions to the company to reduce churned users?
#### The behavior of churned users
- The new customers who have transactions after creating an account 0-1 day have been ability to churn
- People who have a complaint
- Customers who buy mobile phones tend to churn
- The higher the City Tier, the lower the churn level
- The more accounts a customer registers, the more likely it is to churn
- The closer the customer's last order date gets, the higher the churn rate
- Single people are more likely to churn than married status
- The less cashback customers receive, the higher the churn rate

#### There are some solutions

- Sending emails, reminding customers about upcoming promotions and offering special discounts to new customers
- Building a complaint-handling process, receiving, find the cause and resolving complaints
- With people who complained => Reaching out to them to get their feedback, identify and analyze common complaints, fix underlying problems and offer solutions as well as offer them voucher
- Offer customers other products for cross-selling or up sell customer
